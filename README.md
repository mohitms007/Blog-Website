# Blog-website-with-backend
My first backend Website in which we can write a diary and changes will get backed up to your server using Express,Nodejs and EJS

## Minimalistic website with less clutter and all content.

### Intructions to use this website as a Template:
    1. compose with going to "{server-host}/compose"
    2. Install all the packages needed with npm install.
    3. ENJOY!!
